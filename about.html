<h3>My Future Career: Professional Basketball Player</h3>

<p>I have always wanted to be a professional basketball player ever since I first played which was when I was seven years old. I always played soccer before that but I was never good until I was told I would be better at basketball so I gave it a try.</p>

<p> I feel I have created a passion into basketball so I train a lot to get better. I will be in the gym all the time practicing some drills just trying to be the best I can be.</p>
